<h2>What we are about</h2>
<main>
    <p>Hello dear visitor welcome to the <em>Marching Band</em> page. Our club is welcoming to players of all experience levels, be it
       first timers just wanting to learn the joys of music, to the more intermediate/advanced players who seek to improve
       their craft. Everyone is welcome here! We have a slew of events and activities that we have available. The main attraction of course is our marching band. We play during
       the football season to support the players during the games, but really we go to show up the other team's band. We have competitions annually with the ever popular <strong><em>Battle of the Bands</em></strong>!
    </p>
    <p>
        Those events do require quite the physical condition especially being out in the sun. Other activities we have include our <strong><em>Symphonic band, Concert band,</em></strong>
        and the ever popular <strong><em>Jazz Band</em></strong> that plays after football season has ended.
    </p>
